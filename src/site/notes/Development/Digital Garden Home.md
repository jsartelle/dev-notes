Welcome! These are [James Sartelle's](https://www.sartelle.dev) personal development notes, written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and published with the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin.

⬅️ If you don't see the list of notes on the left, click the ≡ button! The [[Development/Notes/CSS\|CSS]], [[Development/Notes/React\|React]], and [[Development/Notes/Svelte\|Svelte]] notes are the most comprehensive.

Some notes on these notes:

- They aren't comprehensive! I write them for myself, so I don't include things I already know well or find intuitive.
- You may find broken links, which most likely point to articles I've clipped into my vault. I don't want to reproduce others' work here, but you can usually find them by searching the web for the link title.

You might also be interested in a collection of [Obsidian CSS snippets](https://github.com/jsartelle/Obsidian-Snippets)!
