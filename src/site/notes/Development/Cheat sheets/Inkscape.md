# Convert a raster image to vector

- File > Import > import your raster image (or just drag it onto the canvas)
- Select the image layer
- Path > Trace Bitmap
- Select a mode above (*Single Scan*, *Multicolor*, *Pixel Art*) and play around with the sliders until the preview looks good
- The vector path will be saved as a new layer next to the raster image
