Welcome! These are [James Sartelle's](https://github.com/jsartelle) personal development notes, written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and published with the [Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) plugin.

⬅️ Open one of the folders on the left and start browsing! The [[Development/Cheat sheets/React cheat sheet\|React cheat sheet]] or [[Development/Cheat sheets/CSS cheat sheet\|CSS cheat sheet]] are the most comprehensive.

Some notes on these notes:

- These aren't meant to be comprehensive! I write them for myself, so I don't include things I already know well or find intuitive.
- I clip[^1] a lot of articles written by others into my Obsidian vault. I don't want to reproduce other people's work here, so you'll find some broken links. (In the future I'd like to find a solution that replaces these with a link to the original article.)
