## Bread tips

- replace up to 15% of flour with Expandex for added volume and fluffiness
- use sparkling water for more lift, or beer for more lift and yeasty flavor

### Refrigerator rise

- allow to rise for 20-30 minutes on the counter, then cover airtight (with plenty of space) and refrigerate for 8-12 hours
    - counter rise may not be necessary for high yeast recipes or warm environments
- let dough for loaves warm for 40-60 minutes before shaping, smaller breads like rolls can be shaped immediately
- loaves can be refrigerated after shaping and baked immediately after coming out, but if they haven't risen in the fridge give it some time to warm up

## Roasted garlic

https://www.reddit.com/r/foodhacks/comments/18qz379/comment/key82b0/

> If you like garlic, get a ton of cloves (pre peeled or peel bulbs yourself) then put them in an oven safe dish with enough olive oil to cover them. Bake at 375 for 40-60 mins, until garlic is browned and just starting to get dark on the edges. Strain and save your roasted garlic olive oil for cooking later, then put the cloves in a blender with a few pinches of salt and blend into a nice smooth paste. Keep in the fridge for sauces, stir fry, garlic bread, rice - anything a bit of garlic will help! Roasting makes the flavor richer and nuttier too, and since the garlic is already cooked it can be added to almost anything.

## Caramelized onions

> Onions are cheap and fresh this time of year. Bonus for 25-lb bags!
>
> Put on your favorite show and dice up 10 or more pounds of onions. Then steam them in a big stockpot for 5-10 minutes with as little water as possible. Sautee with your favorite fat till GBD. You could even do varying degrees of caramelization, or add sautéed garlic. Cool and flat freeze.
>
> When you need sautéed onions, just snap off a corner. You are now 20 minutes ahead before you even grab a pan.
