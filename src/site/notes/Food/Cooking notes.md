## Bread tips

- replace up to 15% of flour with Expandex for added volume and fluffiness
- use sparkling water for more lift, or beer for more lift and yeasty flavor

### Refrigerator rise

- allow to rise for 20-30 minutes on the counter, then cover airtight (with plenty of space) and refrigerate for 8-12 hours
    - counter rise may not be necessary for high yeast recipes or warm environments
- let dough for loaves warm for 40-60 minutes before shaping, smaller breads like rolls can be shaped immediately
- loaves can be refrigerated after shaping and baked immediately after coming out, but if they haven't risen in the fridge give it some time to warm up
